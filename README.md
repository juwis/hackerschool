HackerSchool project

This project is using the ESP8266 microcontroller with an integrated WiFi Module. This microcontoller is using the [Micropython](https://micropython.org) and some python written modules.

The main module is the webserver, which provides a [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) webpage with custom modules. The Custom modules are used for the hardware to build your own robotic device.
